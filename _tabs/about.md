Whether you're struggling to understand if you should be using AI in your business or whether you need practical hands on 
help to deliver an AI project, I'm here to help. 

I'm Gareth Davies and I love creating things with technology and have a particular interest in machine learning having spent
more than 25 years designing, building and supporting large-scale web based applications in a variety of roles and organisations. 
I am CTO at Cloudapps, a company that sells an AI driven Revenue Intelligence SaaS platform to enterprise customers.
Bringing high quality competitive capabilities to market in short time frames is critical to our success 
and when resources and budgets are tight, as they often are, it's vital that I can be as hands on as much as possible, so in addition to fulfilling the usual 
CTO responsibilities I'm also the company's data scientist and conduct all our AI research and development.

In 2017 I was tasked with evaluating how Cloudapps could use AI to improve its product offering by introducing valuable Insights to Sales 
Reps and using our software to guide the selling process. Our Salesforce app collected huge amounts of activity data and we were confident that we could generate more value
out of it having developed our own rules based algorithms to produce opportunity scores some years earlier. AI and machine learning were 
familiar terms, but surprisingly little information existed on how to use it to make a production ready application. I set about the challenge of learning how to do this and entered an unfamiliar but fascinating world inhabited by strange words and 
mathematical disciplines that I hadn't touched since university. Knowing what resources I could trust
was initially my biggest problem, honestly even in those days there was so much "snake oil" out there it was difficult to separate fact from fiction. 
Eventually and more by luck than judgement I got on the right track and started using material from people who I know now 
are some of the great pioneers in the field. Evenings and weekends were spent taking courses, studying youtube university lectures and 
experimenting with my own data and as I got more proficient my eyes were opened to the possibilities of what machine learning could and could not do.

In particular I was drawn to neural networks, universal function approximators that can mould themselves to any problem from computer vision to
natural language processing. I read about how a neural network was used to forecast taxi journeys in Portugal and predict grocery sales from stores 
in Germany and convinced myself that we could use it for our needs. It was pretty unconventional at the time, but we took a punt that this was 
the future of AI and set about developing a deep learning based platform which specialised in making predictions from tabular 
data to deliver the Sales Insights and the Guided Selling that we wanted. While the effort was not insignificant in a few months myself and two 
other engineers had built a general purpose multi-tenanted machine learning platform that could make predictions using the latest deep learning 
techniques with our own custom models. The serverless technologies we chose meant that it cost a few hundred dollars a month to run and would 
scale as we onboarded customers. 

That was a few years ago now and we've learnt a lot since then about how to make neural networks perform really well to solve a wide range of business problems. 
Our models have been shown to produce more accurate predictions that Salesforce Einstein in scoring opportunities and we have customers 
who are using the platform to solve problems that we could never have envisioned. As our knowledge and understanding of the field increased we 
added capabilities that explained predictions and supported new use cases such as sales forecasting using specialist time series techniques, we've also recognised that for certain classes of problems other machine learning or statistical approaches can create better solutions.

Since the rise of ChatGPT and other LLM's the hype surrounding AI has exploded, which is exciting but creates some challenges. It's 
happened so quickly that there's a real lack of knowledge when it comes to implementing solutions that use AI. It's all very well 
having blue sky thinking with art of what's possible, but unless you know how to go about actually creating a solution then your
program will hit the buffers before it even starts. Secondly, there's so much information available now from so many sources, but
 not all of it is accurate or helpful. Finding reliable accurate information can feel like searching for the holy grail in a minefield. 
As powerful as it is AI is not a silver bullet and shouldn't be default option that we reach for to solve every business problem, 
knowing when and how to use machine learning is half the battle. 

I've been in your position and know how hard it is to get started, but I've picked up a thing or two 
over the years and I created Neural Aspect so that I can share my skills and experience to help take some 
of the hard work out of evaluating or running a program that uses AI. That could be to advise you on whether to solve a particular problem 
with AI, conducting research or analysis with your data, creating POC's, assisting the development of MVP's or providing technical leadership to your development teams.  

I'm always happy to have a discussion about your specific situation and requirements so if you think I can 
help then please do get in touch.
