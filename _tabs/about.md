## Navigating AI Solutions for Your Business

Whether you’re exploring how AI can benefit your business or need hands-on support to deliver an AI-driven project, I’m here to help.

I’m Gareth Davies, Founder of Neural Aspect Ltd and CTO at Cloudapps. With over 25 years of experience in building large-scale, web-based applications, I’ve developed a fascination for machine learning and AI. As CTO at Cloudapps, I lead the development of our AI-driven Revenue Intelligence SaaS platform, where I focus on bringing innovative, high-quality AI capabilities to market, often within tight budgets and timelines. In addition to my CTO responsibilities, I’m the lead data scientist at Cloudapps, responsible for all AI research and development.

In 2017, I was tasked with evaluating how AI could enhance Cloudapps’ product offerings, guiding sales reps with actionable insights. With the wealth of activity data we collected from Salesforce, we were confident that AI could unlock more value beyond our earlier rules-based algorithms. Despite the abundance of AI buzz, there was a surprising lack of guidance on how to make AI production-ready. I delved deep into learning machine learning, entering a world of complex mathematical concepts and technical terms.

My focus soon gravitated towards neural networks—their versatility and power as function approximators were captivating. After studying how these models were used for diverse applications, from forecasting taxi journeys to predicting grocery sales, I was convinced we could apply them to sales insights. In a matter of months, my team and I developed a multi-tenant machine learning platform using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The result? A scalable, cost-effective platform that has outperformed Salesforce Einstein in opportunity scoring and delivered transformative insights for clients.

Today, our models continue to evolve, handling tasks like sales forecasting and opportunity scoring with unmatched accuracy. While neural networks have been central to our approach, I’ve also learned when to leverage other machine learning techniques or statistical models for specific business problems.

With the recent rise of AI and tools like ChatGPT, there’s more hype than ever—and more challenges. Implementing AI solutions requires more than visionary thinking; it demands practical execution. And while there’s no shortage of information, finding reliable, actionable advice is still a challenge. AI isn’t a magic bullet, and success lies in knowing when and how to apply it.

Having been in your shoes, I know how daunting it can be to get started with AI. That’s why I created Neural Aspect: to help businesses like yours navigate the complexities of AI. Whether you need guidance on solving a problem with AI, research and analysis, help developing a proof of concept or MVP, or technical leadership for your team, Neural Aspect can help.

If you’re looking for practical, hands-on AI expertise to drive your business forward, I’d love to discuss how I can support your goals. Please feel free to reach out.
