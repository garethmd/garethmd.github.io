# A discussion with Joshua Harris (Cloudapps) about the future of AI in 2024

The following is a podcast that I recorded with Josh Harris at Cloudapps where we chat about the future of AI in 2024
following a year of LLM's and ChatGPT.

My predictions 
1. Vector Databases will become more commonplace
1. Techniques for Fine-Tuning LLMs will be improved
1. The search for greater context length will continue
1. Hybrid models will become more commonplace in timeseries forecasting and tabular predictions
1. Domain specific Chatbots will become more commonplace
1. LLM's will become more integrated into application systems
1. OpenAI will become AI as a Service (AiaaS)
1. The tensions between Open Source and Closed Source will continue
1. Regulation of the industry will not happen before the election
